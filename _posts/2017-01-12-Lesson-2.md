Today we explored denary (or more commonly referred as decimals)and the simplicity of hex codes. I was confused when Mr Keen was explaining why people are being lazy as he referred to the phrase CBA which means Can't Be Asked which I didn't know what it meant at that time. I asked him what it meant at which time some people sniggered. This made Mr Keen  talk to us about hope and courage in everyday life and how we should not give up  showed us a video on a Japanese toddler trying to jump over a vaulting apparatus. After failing a few times he finally succeeded and was feeling very happy. I should always be brave and ask questions that are "funny" to other people however not ask silly question
