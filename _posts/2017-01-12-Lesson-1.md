In this lesson we learned about binary how easy it is to use. Computer use binary by asking yes or no questions, yes is 1 and no is 0. It carries on without any repetitions. How does it get 3? It doubles every time, in an eight bit computer you go up to 256 so  it goes like 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256  1 lot of 1 plus 1 lot of 2 equals three! There are 255 digits in an eight bit computer but 256 possibilities including 0. I managed to understand everything in the lesson but hadn't really put my hand up so my EBI would be to be confident and put my hand up even if I am wrong.
