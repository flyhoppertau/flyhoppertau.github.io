In the last few weeks,we were doing some coding on Google sheets. I got on fairly well, only struggling in the last few tasks lol concatenating and trying to "teach Google to count". The good part of being good at Google sheets is to be able to help  others who are struggling to get the job done (in effect I was a teacher). The best part of IT is not being able to do things. You might think that I might have gone cuckoo but my reasoning is very good and simple behind this; you come to IT thinking you are smart and able to do something that you can, but when you get it wrong you try to fix it and get other answers instead of just getting one single answer. I did not lay it out in a table because then the table would be too laboriously long. The only problem I have right now is that I cannot get my avatar to load up on screen.
