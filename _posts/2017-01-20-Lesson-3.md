    <td>By not talking to anyone, I found it easier to get on with my work. I also made up my mind that I would treat this like a race, so this made me work as fast as I could. I also tried to read the instructions quickly and put it in code.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The only thing that limited my learning was time. I could have stayed in IT1 for days on end trying to get all the code done(I was actually liking it). Unfortunately I didn't have that much time and had to leave it </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I, for one, will bring my planner and pencil case to every lesson because I was worried that I would be late to registration and if you are late to registration you get a break time detention. This is probably the only EBI.</td>
